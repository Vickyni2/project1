                    <p>Being a professional photographer means working with people 
                        whether it’s a client, a model, or even a fellow photographer. 
                        Thus, being a good photographer requires good people skills 
                         it’s one of the essential photographer qualities.

                    <p>When you’re photographing people, knowing
                        how to take a good photo simply isn’t enough. 
                       You also have to know how to interact with your
                        subjects to make them feel at ease, get them to cooperate, 
                       or draw out all the right emotions out of them.
